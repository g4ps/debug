This project is an attemt to make a debug program;
Total goal is to make it an interactive memory lurker with maybe some additional stuff

A lot of features are reflecting stuff, that I am in the process of learning

Adding this project to github, probably should tell more about it. It is all above mentioned,
works on linux and utilizing /proc folder. It probably has something to do with a lot of 
stuff, that i dont know, but once again, I did it for fun. It doesn't work at this point, but i wanna finish it later.
